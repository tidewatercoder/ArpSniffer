# ArpSniffer
I created this ARP table for a class project.

Important - You must download and install npcap to so the code can work!

The code can only scan 254 addresses and is meant for a /24 class c network,
other networks can be scanned but it will only return 254 addresses.

I did add a gui into the code using pysimplegui, but it was not required for the class project.
